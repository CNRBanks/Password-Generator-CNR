# Connor Banks Tamminen's Random Password Generator

## Description

My goal was to create a password generator that would allow users to create a randomly generated password using symbols, numbers, lowercase characters and uppercase characters.


## Usage

Users can click on any of the generate password button shown in the center of the page and the site will automatically prompt the user to a series of questions on the length and characters used in the password. Once the user has completed the prompts their password will display in the text box on the center of the screen.
